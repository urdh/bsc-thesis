This report describes the work with and theory behind the
implementation of a program that can identify a number of different
static gestures with high accuracy. The report also describes methods
which use hidden Markov models (HMM) to identify dynamic gestures.

The classification methods used are completely statistical, and use
neither prefabricated hand models nor artificial neural networks. Hand
identification requires the user to wear a shirt with long sleeves,
but in the report methods to identify wrists are described, enableing
relaxation of this requirement.

The analysis is done on prerecorded video clips, but real-time
analysis is not distant in regard to performance and implementation.

With Gaussian Mixture Models for skin identification and \knn
classification for gesture recognition ten static gestures can be
identified with an accuracy of 91.4\,\%. For analysis of dynamic
gestures, results are missing.
